## Vulkan based rendering engine (Working name)

### The following demo was created within this engine

The demo is inspired by the fictional city of Luthadel, described in the novel “Mistborn”
by Brandon Sanderson. The city is perpetually covered in thick mists and ash falling
from the sky. The atmosphere is ominous. The lighting has a dark red tint and is
generally gloomy, thanks to the thick clouds covering the sun.

Some of the graphical effects / features demonstrated:
- Screen space ambient-occlusion
- Screen space reflections
- Volumetric fog
- Cascade directional Shadows

The demo is tested and running with 60fps minimum on Nvidia GTX 1060 class graphics.
